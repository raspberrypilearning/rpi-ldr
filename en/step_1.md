Light Dependent Resistors (LDR), also known as photoresistors, are electronic components that change their resistance based on the amount of light they are exposed to. LDRs can be used to detect light levels and trigger actions based on changes in lighting conditions.

LDRs work by decreasing their resistance as the intensity of light increases. This property makes them useful for applications that require light sensing, such as automatic lighting systems, light-activated alarms, and environmental monitoring. 

By connecting the LDR to a GPIO pin and reading the changes in resistance, you can program your Raspberry Pi to respond to varying light conditions. For example, you could create a system that turns on a light when it gets dark or adjusts the brightness of a display based on the ambient light.
